QUESTION 87
How would an AWS customer easily apply common access controls to a large set of
users?
A.Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.
B.Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.
C.Apply the same IAM policy to all IAM users with access to the same workload.
D.Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to
create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers,accounting, etc.).
Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those
groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That
way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move
around in your company, you can
simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

QUESTION 90
Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
A.Implement single points of failure.
B.Implement loose coupling.
C.Implement monolithic design.
D.Implement vertical scaling.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It
involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them. The two
components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through
an intermediate durable storage layer. This approach decouples the two components and
introduces additional resiliency. So, for example, if a process that is reading messages
from the queue fails,
messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.
Reference: https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/
QUESTION 91
Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Select
TWO.)
A.Enable AWS CloudTrail.
B.Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
C.Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
D.Enable Amazon CloudFront.
E.Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
Answer: BE
Explanation:
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access
by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for
them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow
you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use
case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised. For example, if a
monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS
environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define
the minimum set of permissions for
each tool.

What are the multiple, isolated locations within an AWS Region that are connected by
low-latency networks called?
A.AWS Direct Connects
B.Amazon VPCs
C.Edge locations
D.Availability Zones
Answer: D
Explanation:
Each Region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the
Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency links. A Local Zone is an
AWS infrastructure deployment that places select services closer to your end users. A
Local Zone is an extension of a Region that is in a different location from your Region. It
provides a high-bandwidth backbone to the AWS infrastructure and is ideal for
latency-sensitive applications, for example machine
learning.

QUESTION 147
When is it beneficial for a company to use a Spot Instance?
A.When there is flexibility in when an application needs to run.
B.When there are mission-critical workloads.
C.When dedicated capacity is needed.
D.When an instance should not be stopped.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers
such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate. Cloud service providers invest in
hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to
subscribers. One of the problems with this business model, however, is that at any given
time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized.
These resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle,
and not making AWS any money at the moment.
Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a
substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those
resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot
instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.
In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.

QUESTION 149
How does AWS charge for AWS Lambda?
A.Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.
B.Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.
C.Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.
D.Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources.
Answer: D
Explanation:
AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by
the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute. When code starts running in
response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request. It will charge the total number of
requests across all of the functions used. Duration is calculated by the time when your
code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 100ms.
The AWS Lambda pricing depends on
the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.
Reference: https://dashbird.io/blog/aws-lambda-pricing-model-explained/
QUESTION 150
What function do security groups serve related Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2) instance security?
A.Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance.
B.Secure AWS user accounts with AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
C.Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
D.Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.
Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both
inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to
assign it to a particular security group.
After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers
over the internet.
AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still
customize it according to your liking (although we don't recommend this practice because
groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group
that you want for your specific applications.
To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make
the process easier.

QUESTION 151
Which disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?
A.Backup and restore
B.Pilot light
C.Warm standby
D.Multi-site active-active
Answer: D
Explanation:
Backup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and
restores data as needed. Keep in mind that because none of your data is on standby, this
method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.
Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be
quickly
retrieved if needed.
Warm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your business' core elements
running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime and an almost seamless
transition.
Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your
company's data/applications between two or more active locations and splits your
traffic/usage between them. If a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the
unaffected area, which means you'll suffer almost zero downtime.
However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur
much higher costs.

QUESTION 153
Which of the following provides the ability to share the cost benefits of Reserved
Instances across AWS accounts?
A.AWS Cost Explorer between AWS accounts
B.Linked accounts and consolidated billing
C.Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Reserved Instance Utilization Report
D.Amazon EC2 Instance Usage Report between AWS accounts
Answer: B
Explanation:
The way that Reserved Instance discounts apply to accounts in an organization's
consolidated billing family depends on whether Reserved Instance sharing is turned on or
off for the account. By default, Reserved Instance sharing for all accounts in an
organization is turned on. You can change this setting by Turning Off Reserved Instance
Sharing for an account.
The capacity reservation for a Reserved Instance applies only to the account the
Reserved Instance was purchased on, regardless of whether Reserved Instance sharing
is turned on or off.

Which AWS hybrid storage service enables on-premises applications to seamlessly use
AWS Cloud storage through standard file-storage protocols?
A.AWS Direct Connect
B.AWS Snowball
C.AWS Storage Gateway
D.AWS Snowball Edge
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AWS Storage Gateway service enables hybrid cloud storage between on-premises
environments and the AWS Cloud. It seamlessly integrates on-premises enterprise
applications and workflows with Amazon's block and object cloud storage services
through industry standard storage protocols. It provides low-latency performance by
caching frequently accessed data on premises, while storing data securely and durably in
Amazon cloud storage services. It provides an optimized data transfer mechanism and
bandwidth management, which tolerates unreliable networks and minimizes the amount
of data being transferred. It brings the security, manageability, durability, and scalability of
AWS to existing enterprise environments through native integration with AWS encryption,
identity management, monitoring, and storage services. Typical use cases include backup
and archiving, disaster recovery, moving data to S3 for in-cloud workloads, and tiered
storage.Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/faqs/

QUESTION 167
Which architectural principle is used when deploying an Amazon Relational Database
Service (Amazon RDS) instance in Multiple Availability Zone mode?
A.Implement loose coupling.
B.Design for failure.
C.Automate everything that can be automated.
D.Use services, not servers.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for
Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads.
When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a
primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a
different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent
infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure,
Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the
case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the
failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a
failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual
administrative intervention.

QUESTION 169
What is a benefit of loose coupling as a principle of cloud architecture design?
A.It facilitates low-latency request handling.
B.It allows applications to have dependent workflows.
C.It prevents cascading failures between different components.
D.It allows companies to focus on their physical data center operations.
Answer: C
Explanation:
IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies. Your
components need to be loosely coupled to avoid changes or failure in one of the
components from affecting others.
Your infrastructure also needs to have well defined interfaces that allow the various
components to interact with each other only through specific, technology-agnostic
interfaces. Modifying any underlying operations without affecting other components
should be made possible.

A. It ensures on-premises data storage is 99.999999999% durable.
B. It transports petabytes of data to and from AWS.
C. It connects to multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
D. It connects on-premises data storage to the AWS Cloud.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch. For companies that
have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps
to consider --and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so
quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected
growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do
exactly that).
AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. It's a hybrid
storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems
to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.
